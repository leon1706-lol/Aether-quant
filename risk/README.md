# risk

Owns V2 dynamic risk controls:

- volatility-adjusted position sizing
- leverage caps
- drawdown-aware sizing
- liquidity checks
- market-impact and slippage controls

This package should reuse the existing conservative risk-control behavior and extend it gradually.

Current V2-7 behavior:

- classifies rolling volatility into low, normal and high regimes
- scales target position weight toward a target daily volatility
- reduces exposure in high-volatility regimes
- allows controlled expansion in low-volatility regimes
- emits leverage/sizing telemetry for the future HTML volatility dashboard

## Learned topology → position sizing (optional, shrink-only)

`position_sizing.py::topology_sizing_multiplier(topology_source,
topology_confidence, topology_disagreement, min_topology_multiplier=0.5,
max_topology_multiplier=1.0)` adds a third, optional factor to the
`volatility_multiplier × confidence_multiplier` chain, sourced from the
learned probabilistic topology overlay (V2-17.5,
`topology/learned_topology.py`) that previously only reached the
dashboard and the offline retrain-trigger pipeline, never a trade.

- A strict no-op (`1.0`) unless `topology_source == "learned"` — the
  overlay's own confidence-gated label, absent whenever the model is
  missing/disabled/still warming up. Otherwise:
  `multiplier = min + (max-min) * confidence * (1-disagreement)`, always
  `<= max_topology_multiplier` (`1.0` by default) — it can only shrink an
  already-sized position, never amplify it beyond what the deterministic
  volatility/confidence factors alone would produce.
- Deliberately **not** wired into `analyzer/market_analyzer.py`'s
  `trade`/`simulate`/`observe`/`reduce_risk` decision — see
  `analyzer/README.md` for why that integration point stays
  deterministic. This lives here instead because sizing already exists
  purely as a continuous multiplier chain applied *after* the analyzer has
  decided to trade, so adding a symmetric, shrink-only factor changes only
  *how large* an approved trade is, never *whether* it happens.
- Config: `phase_v2.dynamic_risk.topology_sizing_enabled` (default
  `true`), `min_topology_multiplier` (`0.5`), `max_topology_multiplier`
  (`1.0`) — a dedicated kill switch independent of
  `phase_v2.topology_learning.enabled` (which also gates the unrelated
  dashboard/retrain-trigger consumers).
- Wired via `main.py::_build_dynamic_sizing_payload(..., topology=...)`.
